# plato
Some Asymptote animations and interactives for group theory. Mainly about Platonic solids.

solids.asy includes constructors for the Platonic solids and a function for animating their rotations.
animation2.asy is a slight modification of the built-in animation.asy that allows better control over timing of the output gif. 
twoOctaRotations.asy gives a usage example.

Here is a WebGL interactive graphic showing a dodecahedron with its five right-handed embedded tetrahedra, generated by allRightTets.asy. https://asymphost.xyz/asy/3e8d7b41-e0da-4a3c-a2b6-33980eec9c49.html
